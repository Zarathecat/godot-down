(used in the godot tutorial. Were adjusted to make unique!)

This currently changes very little of the boilerplate
`ui_input` movement you get when you first add a
CharacterBody2D class. The godot engine advises that
you change it. Well, may one day change it to use inputs
in the recommended way, but since there currently *is* no
UI for this, it doesn't really matter for now. :)
